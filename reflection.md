1. Define CI and CD in your own words

CI (Continuous Integration) is about automatically checking and testing code every time developers make changes, so we know early if something is broken.
CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is about automatically releasing or deploying the tested code to production or staging, so updates reach users faster and with fewer errors.

2. Why is automation important in software development?

Automation removes repetitive manual work, like running tests or deploying apps. This saves time, reduces human mistakes, and makes the development process faster and more reliable.

3. How can CI/CD pielines improve framework and software quality?

CI/CD pipelines ensure that every code change is tested and validated before being merged. This catches bugs early, keeps the software stable, and makes updates more consistent. Overall, it improves code quality, speeds up delivery, and builds confidence that the system will work properly.

4. What challenges did you face while setting this up?

The challenges that I have experienced is the wrong placement of test file. I have added the test file in the app folder which is it should be in the root directory.
